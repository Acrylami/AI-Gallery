Introducing object translator. Upload literally anything and let AI tell what its called in other langauges.

### 🎨 Style Transfer

You can be Picasso! or Da Vinci or Salvador Dali. 
You can be the artist. Upload your picture along with the style you love and let AI mix that for you. The output you get is an artistic painting you always wanted to  paint yourself. 

* Upload a content image and a style image and let our application paint your content image with the styles in your style image
